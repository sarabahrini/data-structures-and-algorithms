# Hashtables
<!-- Short summary or background information -->

## Challenge
Implement a Hashtable with the following capabilities:
1. A method/function named add that takes in both the key and value. This method should hash the key and add the key and value pair to the table.
2. A method/function named find that takes in a key and returns the value from key/value pair.
3. A method/function named contains that takes in a key and returns if the key exists in the table already.
4. A method/function named getHash that takes in a key and returns the index in the array the key is stored.
5. A method/function named serialize that returns serialized Hashtable data.
6. A method/function named deserialize that returns a new Hashtable from serialized Hashtable data.

## Approach & Efficiency
An array is use to represent a HashTable for efficiency in storing and retrieving data.
